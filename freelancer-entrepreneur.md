Freelancer

I recently read the Book E Myth and he talk about those that start a business because they have a high technical skill will run into disappointment and frustration.

A Freelancer that is a Technician. i would include dropshipping and others too like YouTubers. You are working in the Business supplying yout time to do value delivery for a platform.

I Thought that I would rather create a platform of my own. But I don't have to invent my own technology.

Something along the lines of UGC (User Generated content) This was explored in games many years back like Little Big Planet and other platforms such as Steam and YouTube is a form of UGC.

Blockchain is also a platform.
